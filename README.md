    SetupWars: It's your time to flex! (Archived)
 </h2>

ðŸ“¢ **Notice**: This project is now archived. I'm currently working on a new version of SetupWars that uses Bootstrap instead of Tailwind. Check out the new repository here: [SetupSphere](https://github.com/Trexxin/SetupSphere).

SetupWars was a web application designed with the purpose of allowing users to submit and find pc workspaces. Its goal was to promote the discussion of people's setups and to provide prospective users with the means necessary to take inspiration from others. The application was planned to have features that would make the process of finding what tools and hardware a user used to make their workspace easier for others.

## Work in progress
[SetupWars_WIP_8-1-2022.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52933202/182259827-21d399d5-441c-4408-add4-f0447367feab.webm)

Please keep in mind that this application was being created by a single developer so features might have come out slowly or far in between. I was dedicated in what I did, so if there were any issues, users were encouraged to make an issue post on GitHub.

## To do (For Archived Version)

- Create a landing page
- Allow users to create profiles
- Allow users to submit photos and other details about their pc setups
- Incorporate photo area links
- Implement messaging between users and the ability to comment on another user's posting
- Include moderation through the use of word filtering and an admin panels.
