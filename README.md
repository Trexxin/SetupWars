    SetupWars: It's your time to flex!
 </h2>

SetupWars is a web application designed with the purpose of allowing users to submit and find pc workspaces.
It's goal is to promote the discussion of people's setups and to provide prospective users with the means necessary to take inspiration from others.
The application will have features that will make the process of finding what tools and hardware a user used to make their workspace easier for others. 


## Work in progress

Please keep in mine that this application is being created by a single developer so features may come out slowly or far in between. However, I am dedicated in what I do so if there are any issues please make an issue post on github and I will try to get it fixed as fast as I can!

## To do

- Allow users to create profiles
- Allow users to submit photos and other details about their pc setups
- Incorporate photo area links
- Impelment messaging between users and the ability to comment on another users posting
- Include moderation through the use of word filtering and an admin panels.
